This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##Â WHat this app does

1. Connects to Google Places to allow a user to type a location
2. Takes the location and returns geo data
3. Uses the geodata to make an API call to the weather API

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
